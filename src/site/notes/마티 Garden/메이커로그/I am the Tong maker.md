Seoul came down to Tongyeong on January 28, the day after a heavy snowfall warning was issued. It's cold in the morning in the south, but there was a certain warmth that felt the energy of the south. I spent two nights in a space focused on work rather than a place optimized for lodging, and when I leave the room and come out to the lounge, community makers dreaming of starting a business, meta:maketowners, greet each other.
On the morning of the last day of the 3 days and 2 nights, we had an interview with the maker, the last part of Disquiet's Makertown event.

The interview was a process of getting to know how a person has lived since how deeply entrepreneurship entered his life. I lived like the saying goes, "A dog that has eaten wants to eat more." After graduating from school, I was interested in starting a business early, tried and suffered, but as if I couldn't eat the last piece, I experienced the operation of a business like a simple outsourcing company and ended 10 years ago. It seems to have been since then.

Like Fabre's dog, I fell in love with stories, news, information, meeting people, meeting people, attending hackathons, winning championships, mentoring, and immersing myself like crazy. Even though my body was full and tired, I immersed myself in it as if I were taking drugs, slept for 2 nights and 3 days, made a product, showed it to actual users, and enjoyed the process of being evaluated like a drug. to fill the body. Just as life doesn't come for free, the body wanted a receipt for herniated disc surgery, and from 5 years on, I got a big stigma to play this long game in a different way.

As the interview story was approaching the end, I gradually thought to myself why I was here. When I was young, I tried "learn through work" with the advice of a professor who gave a wonderful presentation at a conference seminar. Even after that time had passed, I was exhausted from continuing to try. In the words of one community organizer, “grow in your community.”

After hearing this story, I dreamed of a community of people with similar dreams and goals, not just a community of 00 tool user groups. I wanted to receive the strength to go further with the passion and kinship of the people I had. I found the fastest way here in town, an environment that helped me get rid of my laziness and daze, which had been away from coding for over a month, and allowed me to go the right way again, the way I wanted to go. The fastest road led by passion, and shoveling is also the fastest road. Today, I learned and even distributed one.

I don't know what scene the last scene of this site project will be, but the scenario that I can enjoy and have fun with people with similar passions I meet is confirmed through "Slide2.live as a video of a sleeping slide". I met it in the community. It seems like this time it will be a side project with a slightly different finale. It is not a code to be stored in a warehouse in the corner of an external hard drive, but it is lacking, but a story flower will bloom with the warmth of the south. Fin.
